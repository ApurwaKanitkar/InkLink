            Every friendship day brings to life a dreamscape of happy faces tying friendship bands, celebrating the
            self-chosen family. It is a relation that helps us navigate complex landscapes in the odyssey of life. Be it
            the occasions of euphoric bliss or moments that dampen the spirit, a true friend always stands by us. Right
            from childhood, we live the phrases like — “sharing is caring” and “a friend in need is a friend indeed”.
            Through friends, we learn to form connections, grow, and evolve individually. As we grow older, the
            frequency of those coveted gatherings and leisurely phone calls reduces to some extent, buoyed by busy
            schedules. But the bonds with firm foundations stand the test of time and become stronger. When friends
            meet, even after countless days, the depth and affection remain unaltered, as — “True friends are never
            apart, maybe in distance but never in heart!”.
        </p>
        <p class="font2 mx-1 my-2" style="text-align: justify;">
            Friendship transcends the shackles of socio-economic status. It is well evident in the exemplary bond
            between lord Krishna and Sudama. Lord Krishna belonged to a royal background, while Sudama was born in a poor
            household. They went different ways after studying together during childhood. Nevertheless, they did not
            leave hopes of reuniting. The epitome of virtue, Sudama, remained dedicated and devoted to his beloved friend
            Krishna. When Sudama visited Lord Krishna after years of being apart, it was a poignant reunion. The guards
            of the palace laughed him away, looking at his tattered clothes. But Lord Krishna, on hearing about his
            friend’s arrival, rushed to the gates & hugged him. He invited Sudama inside, washed his feet, and happily
            ate the modest food that Sudama had brought for him. Such a pristine friendship is seldom seen and continues
            to inspire generations.

            Another such saga is that of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Subedar Tanhaji Malusare. They were close
            comrades since their youth. Their tale is a pinnacle of loyalty and trust. When the Kondhana fort was
            captured by the Mughals, Tanhaji undertook the mammoth mission of recapturing it, despite the occasion of his
            son’s wedding falling during the same time. Staying true to his words, he made sure that the Maratha flag
            stood tall at the fort but lost his life in the process. To honor his sacrifice and valor, Chhatrapati
            Shivaji Maharaj renamed the fort — “Sinhagad”, meaning “Lion’s Fort”. The local songs called powadas stand
            testimony to their story.

            Life is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride to be enjoyed with a bunch of friends. Some of them are a
            transient part of our journey while some stay till the very end. But each one plays a special and unique role
            of tremendous value. Undoubtedly, the only way to have a friend is to be one.
