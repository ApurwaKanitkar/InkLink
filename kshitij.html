            <br>
            Dive into the thrilling world of chess challenges with a game that I crafted in Unity! I recently stumbled upon a unique puzzle that couldn’t be found anywhere else on the internet.

            <B>Rules</B>
            <br>
            <B><I>Objective:</I></B> Brace yourself for the ultimate chess challenge – exchange the positions of the white and black bishops on a tightly packed 5x4 chess board.
            <br>
            <B><I>Board Size:</I></B> The game unfolds on this compact battlefield, where the 5x4 board limits the movement of your chess pieces, adding an extra layer of excitement to the puzzle.
            <br>
            <B><I>Piece Placement:</I></B> Every piece stands proudly on squares of the same color, setting the stage for a visually striking and uniquely challenging experience.
            <br>
            <B><I>Non-Interference:</I></B> Here’s the twist – no bishop of a different color can dare to step into the attack range of another! It’s not just chess; it’s a strategic showdown.
